Band Site
=========

This repo demonstrated the code that would have been used for a band site I was asked to make before they pulled out halfway through.

I've added it to my portfolio so as to not to let it go to waste.

The background image used on the home page was sourced from [http://temple-news.com/arts/spause-indie-band-presents-pleasant-april-fools-day-surprise/](http://temple-news.com/arts/spause-indie-band-presents-pleasant-april-fools-day-surprise/). I take no ownership nor credit for it, it was simply used as a demonstration for high-resolution imagery used for a full-page image background to give an idea of what the site would look like.

The only modification that may be made to the image in future (if not already) is to create lower resolution images to test a responsive solution across mobile devices.
